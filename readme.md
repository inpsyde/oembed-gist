# oEmbed Gist
Autoembedding of Gists in WordPress via oEmbed with caching. No shortcodes, no bullshit.

### Usage
Paste a gist link into a blog post or page and it will be embedded eg:
`https://gist.github.com/2290887`

If a gist has multiple files you can select one using a url in the following format:
`https://gist.github.com/2290887?file=file_example.php`

You find the links always on the link hash on a gist on each file.
